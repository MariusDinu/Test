# Test

Install Node.js on the server
Add your Node.js app to the server (an easy way to do this is by cloning a GitHub repository)
Install the npm dependencies for your Node.js app and make sure it runs correctly
Install and configure PM2 (Node.js Process Manager) that you will run your Node.js app with and keep it running forever in the background
Get your Node.js app running using PM2
Set up Nginx as a reverse proxy for your Node.js app so your app can be accessed via your domain name via HTTPS
